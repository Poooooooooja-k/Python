# conversion of one data type into other data type is known as typecasting
# two types-explicit and implicit conversion 
# explicit-conversion done by the programmer
# implicit-done automatically by python 
a="1"
b="2"
print(a+b)
# output=12    here strings are concatinated
b="pooja"
c="k"
print(b +c)
a="1"
b="2"
print(int(a)+int(b))  
# explicit conversion
# string converted to integer
# output 3
s=1.9
d=8
print(s+d)
# output=3.3
# implicit conversion here python converted to float
